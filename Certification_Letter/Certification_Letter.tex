\maketitle
\LARGE \setlength\parindent{2em} I am writing this letter to certify that zhang wei is an affiliate in Lawrence Berkeley National Lab from Feb 17, 2016 to Jan 8, 2017. During this time, he had independently finished the experiment of \emph{Topmetal-II$^-$} digital readout testing under my guidence. 

\LARGE He had completed entire test task about \emph{Topmetal-II$^-$} digital readout testing and got creditable data.  The testing platform is still placed in Lawrence Berkeley National Lab when the test task is finished, so he can't show whole testing process for you. I guarantee that all the test results and test data are credit in his master thesis. The testing results of \emph{Topmetal-II$^-$} digital readout has already been published in JINST.

\LARGE I ensure that the above statement is the presentation of my true meaning. Thanks for your trust.

\noindent With Best regards

\noindent Yuan Mei
